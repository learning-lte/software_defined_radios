## Tried so far

- Found the [BLE Dump](https://github.com/drtyhlpr/ble_dump).
- 

## Todo
- [ ] Find GMSK demodulator in Python
- [ ] Find Write the data from the FIR filter to a file 
- [ ] Demodulate the FIR 
- [ ] Search for packets
- [ ] Create Fake BLE packets and decode them. IF that works, this should also work.
