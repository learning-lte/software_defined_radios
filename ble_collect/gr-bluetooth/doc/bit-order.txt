We refer to the order of bits in the Bluetooth air interface as "air
order."  Data in this bit order are typically in the form of an
array of some integer type (normally char) with each integer
representing one bit.  This is the form of the stream of input
provided by GNU Radio.  Air order is LSB first.  Examples:
input_items, d_stream
 
We call the order of bits in a typical integer (big-endian or
little-endian depending on the host) "host order."  Data in this bit
order are typically in the form of an integer type with several bits
per integer.  Examples: UAP, LAP
  
If we need an array of one bit per integer that is MSB first, we
append "_host" to the variable name for clarity.  Similarly, if we
need an integer representing more than one bit with the bits
reversed (with respect to host order), we append "_air" to the
variable name.  When possible we try to avoid these situations.
