*** THIS CODE IS CURRENTLY NOT COMPLETE ***

Unless you're in contact with me and are helping develop it, it's not likely to
do what you want.  It does nothing useful.  What it should be able to do in the
near future:

* Control a USRP or USRP2
* Read pcap files
* Print debug info about packets
* Log to pcap file

1.  What is Kismet-Bluetooth

	Kismet-Bluetooth is a Kismet plugin which provides Bluetooth support in
	Kismet.  It relies on gr-bluetooth (http://gr-bluetooth.sourceforge.net/)
	which uses the GNU Radio (http://gnuradio.org/) to perform passive
	monitoring of Bluetooth networks using a USRP or USRP2
	(http://www.ettus.com/).

	It CAN NOT BE USED with 802.11 wi-fi cards, it is a completely different
	protocol.  If you do not have a USRP but have a Bluetooth adapter, try the
	btscan plugin instead.  It performs active scanning of discoverable
	Bluetooth devices.

	Kismet-Bluetooth defines the decoders, loggers, and UI controls for
	Bluetooth networks in a common fashion, and supports reading and writing
	Bluetooth baseband pcap files.

	The Bluetooth baseband protocol is the air interface of Bluetooth.  It
	operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.  There is a separate interface known as
	HCI (Host Controller Interface) that operates between a host computer and
	an attached Bluetooth adapter.  Kismet-Bluetooth uses a software radio
	peripheral to directly access the baseband layer.  It does not operate at
	the HCI layer.  Try hcidump if you want to access HCI.

2.  Caveats

	This code is currently only partially developed and may not provide full
	functionality.

	This code has only been tested on Linux.  GNU Radio works on other
	platforms, this code MAY work on other platforms, but currently it is
	only developed with Linux as a target.

3.  Compiling

	Compiling the Kismet-Bluetooth plugin requires the Kismet source be
	installed and configured.  GNU Radio and gr-bluetooth must also be
	installed.

	By default, Kismet-Bluetooth expects the Kismet source to be in
	/usr/src/kismet; this can be overridden by setting the KIS_SRC_DIR
	environment variable:

		cd plugin-bluetooth
		KIS_SRC_DIR=/home/foo/src/kismet make

	By default, Kismet-Bluetooth expects the GNU Radio include directory to be
	/usr/local/include/gnuradio; this can be overridden by setting the
	GR_INC_DIR environment variable:

		cd plugin-bluetooth
		GR_INC_DIR=/foo/include/gnuradio KIS_SRC_DIR=/home/foo/src/kismet make
	
4.  Installing

	Kismet plugins may be installed system-wide in the plugins directory (by
	default, /usr/local/lib/kismet/) or in the users home directory
	(~/.kismet/plugins)

	The default installation path can be overridden with the KIS_DEST_DIR
	variable if you have not installed Kismet in the default location and
	wish to install the plugin in the system-wide plugins directory:

        cd plugin-bluetooth
        KIS_DEST_DIR=/usr KIS_SRC_DIR=/home/foo/src/kismet make install

    Plugins can be installed in the current users home directory with:

        cd plugin-bluetooth
        make userinstall

5.  Using

	Once the plugin is loaded, Kismet will automatically understand and
	decode pcap files with the Bluetooth link data.

	To capture from a USRP, plug in the USB device, and define a capture
	source in Kismet using the interface 'usrp'.  The device will be
	automatically detected.

	If you have multiple USRP devices connected, Kismet-Bluetooth usese the
	first one it finds.  Kismet-Bluetooth currently is not capable of using
	multiple USRPs simultaneously.

	To capture from a USRP2, connect the device with gigabit ethernet and
	define a capture source in Kismet using the interface 'usrp2'.  The
	device will be automatically detected.

	To enable pcap logging, the logfile must be turned on by adding
	'pcapbtbb' to the logtypes= line of the kismet.conf.
